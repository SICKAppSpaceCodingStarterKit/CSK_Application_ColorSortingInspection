# CSK_Application_ColorSortingInspection

CSK application to check for colored sections within an image.  
This application combines functions of different CSK modules to realize this functionality.

## How to Run

The application includes an intuitive GUI to setup a system to detect and count color objects and to decide if the measurement was correct.  
The application is intended for devices like SIM4000, SIM2x00 family, SIM1012, SIM1004 and SAE with pico-/midiCam 1st or 2nd generation or other GigE Vision cameras.  
It can run with multiple instances in parallel.  
For further information check out the [documentation](https://raw.githack.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Application_ColorSortingInspection/main/docu/CSK_Application_ColorSortingInspection.html) in the folder "docu".

**IMPORTANT**  
Following CSK modules are used for this application via Git subtrees and should NOT be further developed within this repository (see [contribution guideline](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/.github/blob/main/Contribution_Guideline.md) of this GitHub organization):

This application is part of the SICK AppSpace Coding Starter Kit developing approach.  
It is programmed in an object oriented way. Some of the modules use kind of "classes" in Lua to make it possible to reuse code / classes in other projects.  
In general it is not neccessary to code this way, but the architecture of this app can serve as a sample to be used especially for bigger projects and to make it easier to share code.  
Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/.github/blob/main/docu/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit_Documentation.md) of CSK for further information.
